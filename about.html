          <p>
            Sharing my faith is a core part of who I am. Evangelism gives me the
            chance to encourage, uplift, and connect with people on a deeper
            level. Just like coding, it’s about communication, clarity, and
            leaving a lasting impact.

        <div class="about-content">
          <p>
            I grew up playing dominoes, and it’s more than just a game for me;
            it’s strategy, patience, and community. Dominoes teaches me to think
            ahead, adapt quickly, and enjoy the process, which are the same
            skills I apply when working through code challenges.

          <p>
            Basketball has always been a way for me to stay active, build
            teamwork, and sharpen focus under pressure. The game teaches me how
            to think strategically, adapt quickly, and work with others toward a
            common goal; skills that carry over perfectly into both life and
            development.

          <p>
            The gym is where I challenge myself physically and mentally.
            Training consistently has taught me discipline, resilience, and how
            to set goals and work toward them daily. These habits directly fuel
            my growth as a developer and as a person.

        <h2>Piano</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
          <p>
            Playing piano allows me to express creativity and focus in a
            different way. Music sharpens my ability to notice patterns and
            flows, which translates beautifully into problem-solving in code.
            It's both an escape and an inspiration.
